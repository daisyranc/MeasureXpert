            While automatic anthropometric measurement extraction has witnessed growth in recent years, effective, non-contact, and precise measurement methods for dressed humans in arbitrary poses are still lacking, limiting the widespread application of this technology. 
The occlusion caused by clothing and the adverse influence of posture on body shape significantly increase the complexity of this task. 
Additionally, current methods often assume the availability of a complete 3D body mesh in a canonical pose (e.g., "A" or "T" pose), which is not always the case in practice. To address these challenges, we propose MeasureXpert, a novel learning-based model that requires only two unregistered, partial, and dressed body scans as input, and accommodates entirely independent and arbitrary poses for each scan. MeasureXpert computes a comprehensive representation of the naked body shape by synergistically fusing features from the front- and back-view partial point clouds. The comprehensive representation obtained is mapped onto a 3D undressed body shape space, assuming a canonical posture and incorporating predefined measurement landmarks. A point-based offset optimization is also developed to refine the reconstructed complete body shape, enabling accurate regression of measurement values. To train the proposed model, a new large-scale dataset,
consisting of 300K samples, was synthesized. The proposed model was validated using two publicly available real-world datasets and was compared with different relevant methods.
Extensive experimental results demonstrate that MeasureXpert
achieves superior performance compared to the reference methods.
